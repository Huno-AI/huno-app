<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>Huno AI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("Huno" or the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>The App is intended for users who are at least 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a user under 18, we will delete that information promptly.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and password (stored in encrypted form).</li>
  <li><strong>Conversation Data:</strong> The messages you exchange with Huno are stored to provide continuity in your conversations and improve your experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> If you use the journaling feature, your entries are stored securely and associated with your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Voice Data:</strong> If you use the Talk feature, your voice input is processed for speech-to-text conversion. Voice data is processed in real-time and not permanently stored in audio form.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the App, including features used, session duration, and general usage patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for app functionality and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> If you enable notifications, we store your device token to deliver daily reflections and service communications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App's features and functionality</li>
  <li>Enable conversation continuity with Huno</li>
  <li>Process your subscription and manage your account</li>
  <li>Send daily reflection notifications and important service-related communications</li>
  <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve user experience</li>
  <li>Ensure the safety and security of our users and platform</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What We Do NOT Do</h2>
<p>Your privacy is sacred to us. We want to be crystal clear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> sell your personal information to third parties</li>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> share your conversations with advertisers</li>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> build advertising profiles based on your data</li>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> use your conversations to train AI models for third parties</li>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> display advertisements in the App</li>
  <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> track you across other apps or websites</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored on secure servers located in the United States with industry-standard encryption. Conversation data and journal entries are encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
<p>If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the App, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services to operate the App. Each provider is contractually obligated to protect your data and may only use it for the purposes of providing their service to us:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stripe</strong> (payment processing): Processes all subscription payments. We do not store your credit card information. Stripe's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">stripe.com/privacy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>ElevenLabs</strong> (text-to-speech): Generates voice responses for the Talk feature. Text is sent for voice synthesis and not retained by ElevenLabs after processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> (push notifications): Delivers daily reflection notifications and service communications to your device. Device tokens are stored; message content is not retained by Firebase.</li>
  <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (authentication and database): Manages user authentication and securely stores account data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share your conversation content, journal entries, or personal data with any third party for marketing, advertising, or data brokering purposes.</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>We retain your account information and conversation data for as long as your account is active.</p>
<p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account directly from within the App by navigating to Profile → Account Settings → Delete Account. When you delete your account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All personal information, conversation data, and journal entries will be permanently deleted within 30 days</li>
  <li>Anonymized, aggregated data that cannot identify you may be retained for service improvement</li>
  <li>If you have an active subscription, you must cancel it separately through your Apple App Store settings at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions</a>, as we cannot cancel Apple-managed subscriptions on your behalf</li>
</ul>
